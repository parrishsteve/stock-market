# stock-market
A reliable kotlin app with no ads and real-time data. An app to search for stock market symbols and get real-time stock market data

This app uses the RESTful API services at worldtradingdata.com. 

UPDATE 4/20/2020.  I've been informed by worldtradingdata.com that they are no longer going to conduct business.  I will update this repo once I find a new data provider.
